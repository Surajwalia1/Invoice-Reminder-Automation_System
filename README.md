Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following software is installed:

Node.js (v14 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Zapier Webhook URL
Google OAuth Credentials (Client ID & Client Secret)
Backend Setup

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Surajwalia1/Invoice-Reminder-Automation_System.git
cd Invoice-Reminder-Automation-System

Install backend dependencies:
bash
npm install

Replace the following credentials in server.js:
Google OAuth Client ID and Client Secret.
Zapier Webhook URL.
JWT secret key.

Start the backend server:
bash
node server.js
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5008.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
cd frontend

Install frontend dependencies:
bash
npm install

Start the React development server:
bash
npm run dev
The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173.

How It Works
1. Authentication
Users log in securely via Google OAuth.
JWT tokens are generated and passed to the frontend for secure API access.
2. Invoice Dashboard
Users can view a list of invoices with details like:
Client Name and Email
Invoice Amount
Due Date
Status (Pending, Overdue, Paid)
Invoices can be searched and sorted dynamically.
3. Send Reminders
Users can send reminders for unpaid invoices.
A Zapier Webhook is triggered to send automated notifications via email or other integrations.
API Endpoints
1. Google OAuth
GET /auth/google: Redirects to Google for authentication.
GET /auth/google/callback: Handles OAuth callback and generates a JWT token.
2. Invoices
GET /api/invoices: Fetches a list of invoices. (Protected route)
3. Trigger Reminder
POST /api/trigger-automation:
Sends invoice details to the Zapier Webhook for automation.
Example payload:
json
Copy code
{
  "invoiceId": 1,
  "invoiceAmount": 500,
  "dueDate": "2024-12-20",
  "recipientEmail": "Suraj@gmail.com"
}
